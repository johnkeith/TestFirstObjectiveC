One of the big turning points in my learning of Ruby was working through the [TestFirst.org](http://testfirst.org/learn_ruby)'s Ruby materials. It was through Test First Ruby that I really started to grasp how to write methods, how to construct classes, and how things happen as a program executes in Ruby. 

The hardest part for me with learning Objective C with the resources I have found thus far is having the feeling that I don't have a strong understanding of the basics. This rewrite of TestFirst.org's Ruby curriculum is meant to help you establish a strong foundational understanding of Objective C. 

I come from having learned to program in Ruby, with no knowledge of C, so take these solutions with a grain of salt. In all likelihood, there are far better ways to solve these problems.
